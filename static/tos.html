  <h2>Section 5: The information we collect</h2>
  <h3>Section 5.1: The official Algebra-Lessons deployment</h3>
  <li>
    Information that may be unintentionally collected as part of using
    Algebra-Lessons's official deployment may include basic information such as
    your IP address, web traffic when using Algebra-Lessons, etc. This information
    is temporary and is kept until the server is rebooted.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not purposefully collect anyone's information. We try to limit the
    data collected by the official Algebra-Lessons deployment.
  </li>
  <li>
    We do not, will not, and will never knowingly collect the information of
    minors under the age of 13 (or the minimum age required by laws in your
    country).
  </li>
  <h3>Section 5.2: Unofficial Algebra-Lessons Deployments</h3>
  <li>
    We can't give a definitive answer on what information is collected when you
    use a unofficial Algebra-Lessons deployment, only the operator of the
    Algebra-Lessons deployment you're using can.
  </li>
  <li>
    We urge operators to collect and store as minimal information as possible,
    but we can't control what they do.
  </li>
  <h2>Section 6: Control</h2>
  <li>
    We do not have the power to control what unofficial Algebra-Lesson deployment
    operators do with their deployment.
  </li>
  <li>
    We protect information stored on the official Algebra-Lesson deployment by
    limiting access. The only person that has access to the server of which the
    official Algebra-Lesson deployment runs on is the server host and the owner of
    Algebra-Lesson, PlayyUnblocked.
  </li>
  <li>
    We cannot check every deployment for malicious code. If any data such as
    your account gets compromised after you access it on a unofficial
    Algebra-Lesson deployment, we will not be held liable.
  </li>
  <h2>
    Section 7: How we use basic information on the official Algebra-Lesson
    deployment that may be collected accidentally
  </h2>
  <li>
    Your IP address is used to allow you to use the Algebra-Lesson service. This
    is how it works for every website you visit, not just Algebra-Lesson The
    difference is whether or not this data is intentionally collected and
    stored.
  </li>
  <li>
    Info about your web traffic while using Algebra-Lesson is needed to allow you
    to access the service you wish to access.
  </li>
  <li>
    Algebra-Lesson will NEVER sell your info to third-parties, other than to some
    ad companies. We do this so we can make enough money to pay for our server.
  </li>
  <li>
    The official Algebra-Lesson server operator may respond to legal requests and
    assist law enforcement officials in legal investigations if ever needed. We
    can't guarantee we'll always have information to hand out as the information
    that may be collected is automatically destroyed on reboot, but if we do
    still have information relevent to the investigation, we may provide law
    enforcement officials with it. Please redirect all requests regarding data
    with an unofficial Algebra-Lesson deployment to its operator, as we don't have
    control over unofficial deployments and couldn't comply with requests even
    if we wanted to.
  </li>

  <li></li>
  <li>
    As a thank you for supporting Algebra-Lesson, you get access to supporter
    features. This includes a server with an Algebra-Lesson deployment for
    supporters only. We cannot guarantee 100% uptime.
  </li>
  <li>This is NON-REFUNDABLE.</li>
